    "location": "England",
    "Description":["My adventures started in 2005 when I headed off to Southern India, aged 18, with not a lot of money but an incredibly well stocked first aid kit (medical parents + first time away from home) to volunteer in disaster relief following the tsunami. It was a hard lesson in remote living and the white saviour complex.", "Since then I’ve been studying and working in the overlaps between wildlife conservation and international development. I am currently a Research Fellow at Stockholm University looking at better realising the potential of sustainable small-scale fisheries.", "I am incredibly lucky that my career has lent me opportunities to live and work off-the-beaten-track in places like Mozambique, Madagascar, Kenya, Greece, the bit of the River Wandle behind Topps Tiles, and more. When I’m not doing that I can mostly be found somewhere on the Southwest Coast Path as a sometime climber, reluctant runner, enthusiastic kayaker and recovering rugby player.","My beautiful home of Cornwall delivers all of these, but I am looking for a new physical and mental challenge away from my work, with a chance to pause in some wilderness. A little taster of canoeing in Newfoundland left me wanting more and I am heading on the Unpeeled adventure with a delightfully over-romanticised vision of The North, which I’m positive will come back to bite me in the arse (in mosquito form). Can’t wait!", "Becca’s expedition Top Trumps:","Canoe experience: 1 star award from a school trip when I was 15… 3/10", "Foraging knowledge: Likely fatal… 1/10", " Navigation skills: Have got lost inside a pub before… -5/10","Enthusiasm: Dampened only by 9 weeks without cheese… 9/10","Stubborn hardiness: My fallback… 11/10"]

    "Description": [ "I am Tom a Software Engineer and ex-police officer currently working for the Ordnance Survey. Growing up on the edge of the New Forest National Park I did everything I could to hide from the outdoors and it wasn't until my early 20's that I discovered a joy of travelling and exploring the outside world. I have hiked and camped across 3 continents but up to now I have favoured multiple short trips over one long adventure.","I am an experienced navigator in a variety of different terrains and conditions and have completed a couple of very enjoyable shorter canoe expeditions. I have no formal outdoor qualifications and am almost entirely self-taught in camp craft/bush craft. I am always looking for opportunities to pick up new skills and fun ideas.", "This will be second time canoeing the Canadian wilderness and I can't wait to get back out on the water. As someone who loves being in and around water I am most looking forward to seeing how many different excuses I can find to get wet in our 9 weeks out on the river. This expedition will be a step up for me and one of the more challenging things I will have done in my life. July 2022 can't come soon enough!" ]

I am really looking forward to being an active team member in the Unpeeled kayak expedition, and after the year we’ve just had can’t wait to get back out into the wilderness."]
